## 🧪 Tests Included

### **Signup Process Automation**
- **File**: `tests/signup.spec.ts`
- **Purpose**: Automates the end-to-end signup process for the AEMET portal.
- **Coverage**:
  - Navigate to the signup page and fill in the form.
  - Handle manual reCAPTCHA (requires user intervention).
  - Retrieve the API key from the user’s email inbox.
  - Validate successful signup and API key retrieval.
- **Exception Handling**:
  - Handles missing API keys or invalid credentials.

### **API Key and Data Validation**
- **File**: `tests/apiValidation.spec.ts`
- **Purpose**: Validates the functionality of the retrieved API key.
- **Coverage**:
  - Uses the API key to fetch data from the AEMET endpoint.
  - Validates:
    - HTTP status codes.
    - Response structure (fields like `temp`, `pres`, `vel`).
    - Correct formatting of the `datetime` field.
  - Implements parameterized tests for varying input combinations.

## 🚀 How to Launch Tests

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Node.js and npm**:
   Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. You can verify by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Run the following command in the project root:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Running the Tests**
1. **Run All Tests**:
   Execute the following command to run all tests:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```

2. **Run Specific Test**:
   To run a specific test file (e.g., `signup.spec.ts`):
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/signup.spec.ts
   ```

3. **Headed Mode (Optional)**:
   To run tests in a visible browser:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --headed
   ```

### **Additional Notes**
- **Trace Viewer**:
  For debugging failed tests, Playwright’s trace viewer is enabled on first retry. After running tests, you can view traces with:
  ```bash
  npx playwright show-trace trace.zip
  ```

- **Environment Variables**:
  If using dynamic credentials or API keys, consider setting them via `.env` files or environment variables.

## ⭐ Key Features and Best Practices

- **Modularity**: Locators and endpoints are organized into dedicated files for better reusability.
- **Error Handling**: Includes exception handling for missing API keys, invalid responses, and unexpected failures.
- **Logging**: Logs key steps to aid in debugging and analysis.
